# Rebasing

Rebasing is without a doubt one of Git's most misunderstood features. For most people, `git rebase` is a command that should be avoided at all costs. This is probably due to the extraordinary amount of scaremongering around rebasing. _"Rebase Considered Harmful"_, and _"Please, stay away from rebase" _are just two of the many anti-rebase articles you will find in the vast archives of the Internet.

But rebase isn't scary, or dangerous, so long as you understand what it does. But before we get into rebasing, I'm going to take a quick digression, because it's actually much easier to explain rebasing in the context of cherry-picking.
